# Computer_Geometry_Bib
A bibliography of materials related to computer representations of geometry. This includes CAGD (Computer-Aided Geometric Design), solid modeling, computational geometry, and related fields. The material should be of interest to people developing CAD/CAM/CAE software, games, drawing programs, and so on. 

The bibliography is a single large text file in the .bib format used by TeX/LaTeX. 

I created the bibliography for my own use, but I'm publishing it here in the hope that other people will benefit from it (and contrbute to it, also, I hope).
