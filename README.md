# Computer Geometry Bibliography
A bibliography of materials related to computer representations and processing of geometry. This includes CAGD (Computer-Aided Geometric Design), solid modeling, computational geometry, and related fields. The material should be of interest to people developing CAD/CAM/CAE software, games, drawing programs, and so on. 

The bibliography is a single large text file in the .bib format used by TeX/LaTeX. 

I created the bibliography for my own use, but I'm publishing it here in the hope that other people will benefit from it (and contrbute to it, also, I hope).

To contribute using git and/or github, use the standard process ...
  - Fork this repository (e.g. with upper right button on github)
  - Add new entries or modifications in the file: ComputerGeometryBibliography.bib
  - Issue a pull request asking for your changes to be pulled into the master repository
  
For help, please refer to https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests

If you prefer, you can also just email addtions/modifications to me (bubbakittee) at gmail. The email address is obvious, I hope.
